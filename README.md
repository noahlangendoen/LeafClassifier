# LeafClassifier

## Summary:

For this project I collaborated with Peter Van Ness (https://github.com/Peterfvn) on building a leaf classification model. Before building our model we performed the necessary data analysis and performed a transformation on the data for the models that would benefit from this change. We were able to achieve roughly a 98% accuracy from all of our efforts. Model developing involved using scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries for our Random Forests, XGBoost, and SVM models. We also used PyTorch to build a Neural Network.

## Dataset:
